(Forward) Proxy: Ref: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuINJdBPf8I
    1. Candidate B put attendance of candidate A
    2. Employee computer -> Proxy -> Website
    Server does not know who is initiating request, proxy or real client
    Request going forward
    Advantage
        1. Selectively intercept the request, send/block request
        2. Easy to log/monitor request
        3. Cache response, make process faster

Reverse Proxy:

    Advantage
        1. Security (DDos attack prevention, Firewall, Block bot/hackers)
        2. Load balancing
        3. Cache response, make process faster
