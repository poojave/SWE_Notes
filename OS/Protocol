    1. Replication control protocol used by distributed systems (Cassandra, distributed db, fault detections), also known as epidemic
    2. Provide high data avail and reliability
    3. Use version number to record the state of replica
    4. 3 strategies to message (Push, Pull, Push-pull)
    5. Advantage:
        5.1 Take O(log n) rounds to complete information dissemination
        5.2 Simple, highly fault tolerant, robust, convergent consistency
        5.3 Extremely decentralised
    6. Weakness:
        6.1 Latency, slow, not so efficient
        6.2 Debugging is difficult
        6.3 Can't scale in some situations
