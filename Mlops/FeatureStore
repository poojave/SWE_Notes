    ML Feature challenge:
        Hard to reuse (across projects, duplicate effort)
        Training/serving skew (model quality degradation over time due to gap in feature training and serving data)
        Hard to serve (Reliability, low latency)

    1. Reusability is hard to achieve, can be done to some extent by collaboration
    2. Two type of pipeline
        2.1 Operational pipeline (Things run everyday, have SLA)
        2.2 and analytical data pipeline (does not used in prod but used in forcasting)
    3. Challenge is org don't have data maturity and they are building ml maturity on top of that.
    4. Layers of feature store
        4.1 Transformational layer
        4.2 Storage layer
        4.3 Serving layer (Unified)
        4.4 Unified retrieval interface for online and offline
        4.5 Monitoring layer
    5. Checkout the feature store of Gojek, Uber
    6. Whose responsibility the model is .. ml engg, data engg mlops engg? The process is evolving. The ans is yet to see, talk to experienced people.

Building a Real-Time ML Pipeline with a Feature Store - MLOps Live #16, Ref: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCGQR7BSRxs
    1. Challenges:
        1.1 Performance - To calculate feature in real time or live data at scale
        1.2 Robust transformations - aggregations on sliding windows
        1.3 Enrichment - Enrich real time events with historical and operational data
        1.4 Consistency - Between training and serving data otherwise model performance will be impacted
        1.5 Data drift - Based on data drift, model monitoring
        1.6 Feature reuse
        1.7 Feature versioning - Aligning feature with model and feature version in production
