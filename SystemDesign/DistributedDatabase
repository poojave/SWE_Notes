    Characteristics:
        1. Highly consistent (Read after most recent write should have latest data), rather than available
            (Cassandra - Eventual consistency, high availability)
        2. No ACID
        3. Operations
            3.1 create table
            3.2 put(table, key, value), get(table, key) -> value, delete(table, key), list(table, keys), delete(table)
        4. Architecture
        5. What if to increase the sequence number
