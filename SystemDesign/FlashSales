Flash Sales with Redis, Alibaba. ref: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mka-KSHsCJo
    Three phases:
        1. Before promotion
            Customer keeps refreshing event detail page
        2. During promotion
            Lots of at the same time orders
        3. After promotion
            Queries about order status or cancel orders

    Use DB only?
        +ve:
            Row level locking, only request that holds lock can place order and book inventory
        -ve:
            Can't handle concurrency, may be blocked by large number of requests

    Business system to handle flash sales:
        1. Use browser cache and cdn to cache request static data
        2. Use redis to block invalid request
        3. Use redis to cache inventory data and accelerate inventory detection
        4. Use redis to asynchronously write order data to db based on message queue
