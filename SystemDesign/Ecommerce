    1. Inventory: Search, List
        1.1 Elastic search to search product queries of user
        1.2 Can ES be used to maintain inventory? Initially yes, but with scaling,
            1.2.1 it would cause issues as it has no locking mechanism.
            1.2.2 it might be expansive too to save all the data there
            1.2.3 It might be a bad choice when the system grows and has microservice architecture where teams would ask api to share active inventory
        1.3 RDBMS -> ES
        1.4 Saving images: S3 with Blob storage (cheap, separate image and db storage)
    2. Delivery: Status updates, order tracking, notif(email/sms), state machine
    3. Payment: gateway, any currency
        3.1 Payment is not successfully done, the user should be redirected to "Thank you" page after txn i.e. 5min
        3.2 we can add cron job to monitor the txn which has not changed status after 5min, a alert will be triggered on slack for it
    4. Cart: add/remove items
    5. Summary
        5.1 MVP, monolith in beginning
        5.2 Searching the data?
        5.3 Monitoring and debugging?
        5.4 Saving images?
