Tips for good presentations:
    1. Breathe
    2. Yoga or jumping jack to make you tired and forget your nervousness
    3. If you are not prepared then please do not go
    4. Explain it all real, real life examples/your life examples and connect it to yourself too.
    5. What, why, how, demo, call for action

I can interview fellow successful people! It would add values in me too.
